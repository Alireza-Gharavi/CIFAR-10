# Implementing a Classification task on the CIFAR-10 dataset
In this notebook, the achievement is reaching +92% accuracy on CIFAR-10 using an ANN with <800,000 parameters in under 100 epochs. The training and testing phases are performed in two different approaches:
- One using K-fold cross-validation
- Another without any validation dataset and only using train and test datasets for the whole process
